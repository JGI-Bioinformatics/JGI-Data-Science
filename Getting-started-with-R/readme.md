## Getting started with R: Essential R for data manipulation


This workshop is designed to get new R users with no prior programming experience off the ground and running code. Links are provided throughout, including links for experienced programmers. A short lecture (10 min) will orient participants to what the R programming language can do for them, and how to use R online at the JGI or install R on their own computers.  We will then use an interactive code notebook to give users hands-on experience with importing, summarizing and manipulating data, preparing them to work with their own data sets.  Simple graphics capabilities will be shown, although this workshop is intended to ready participants to manipulate data as needed to make more advanced visualizations using ggplot2, which will be demonstrated in the next workshop in the series.
